## Authors

Sydney Simon, Amanda Lee, Ash Fujiyama, Gabby Gu

## Problem Statement

There are a lot of productivity tools online, but not many target extrinsic motivation to incentvize users to continue using the app to increase their productivity. More specifically, people tend to use pomodoro timers with a high likelihood of taking unnecessary breaks, dropping the habit of using it, etc. Tamatimer gamifies focus time to prevent these things from happening by providing a visual progress tracker while motivating them to develop the habit of using the app to keep their Tamagotchi inspired pet alive.

## Target Audience

* Those who need help focusing 
* People working under a time crunch 
* People working on a schedule 
* Students studying for exams 
* Millennial and early Gen-Z who used to play with Tomagochi 

## Description

Tamatimer is a time management chrome extension which enhances user productivity based on the pomodoro study method. Users are encouraged to develop good productivity habits by having to choose and take care of their Tamagotchi inspired pet. Each focus session rewards users with they can use to feed their pet to keep them happy and healthy.
