Notifications go off when
- pomodoro ends (if applicable) 
- break ends (if applicable)
- optional: reminder to do a project if it hasn't been focused on today

Tasks listed in a sidebar.  each task "component" would have
- project name
- selection (if it is chosen to be currently focused on)
- later: how much time you want to spend on the project per day 
  - need to store the amount of time you have spent on the project TODAY (reset at midnight)
- time spent working on it (optional, would require more components in Timer)
- optional: rating (in difficulty?  urgency?  importance?)
  - how would rating work?  1-3 scale? 1-5?
- checkbox to indicate the project is completed.

Timer
- if in pomodoro mode: if timer for focus runs out, switch automatically to break timer (and vice versa)
- left and right arrow buttons: adjust how much time to spend focusing or on break
  - these buttons are not shown if in stopwatch mode
  - 5 min increments
- start/pause button (same location?)
- reset button
- skip button (switch between break and focus)
  - if focus timer is running, add elapsed time to project progress (cumulative score)
- display how much time is left (or how much time has passed, if it is stopwatch)
- optional: name of project you are focused on

Pet
- location in sidebar
- name
- multiple sprites
- health bar
- exp bar
- current level
- inventory of food 
- optional: click or hover interactions with pet (change expressions?)
- optional: health bar state will affect appearance of pet

Food Inventory ideas:
- tomato:  20-49 minutes
- slice of cake: 50-89 minutes
- a whole cake (necessary): 90+ minutes
- mystery item: finished a project

Other
- stopwatch versus pomodoro method (location on timer)
- set length of break timer (optional)
- set length of focus timer (optional)
- reset your game (button in sidebar)
- change your pet (button in sidebar)
- optional: setting to change where timer is located (popup versus sidebar)

Game Mechanics:
- at 4 am, amount of time spent on each project for the day resets
- at 4 am, if amount of time spent does not meet requirement, health is deducted from pet.
- at completion of a pomodoro session (or when stopwatch resets), appropriate amount of food is added to either inventory
- at completion of a project, that project component disappears and a reward is deposited to the player's inventory
- food is used to feed pet. different food items have different food points.
  - mechanic to feed pet: drag and drop? button?
  - can food be given to pet if pet is already at full health?
    - exp mechanic: exp is gained when pet is fed while pet health is full.
- health goes down if focus session is skipped
- what happens if health reaches zero?
  - pet loses 5 levels (or level is set to zero if current level < 5)
- change pet: 
  - pet object deleted
  - new pet instance created
  - food inventory and project list is untouched.
- reset triggered:
  - pet object is deleted
  - new pet (egg?) is created
  - food inventory is cleared
  - project list cleared
- max value assignment: TODO later
  - pet health:
  - pet exp: 
  - carrot: how much health/exp it give? is health/exp values the same, or are they diff?
    - same with cake and cake slice
  - level in which pet levels up
